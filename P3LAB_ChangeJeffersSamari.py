# Consider these two functions to pluralize the coin types
# in the output.They were written by ChatGPT when I asked how I might 
# classify the different types of pluralization in English.
# Look how simple and elegant this is. Easily would have taken me
# hours, if not days, to build this on my own. And it would not
#  be nearly as pretty.
# Some lessons to take from this:
# My first mistake was scope creep: I wanted to have a reusable
#  function that would pluralize every word in the English language.
#  Retrospectively, not necessary. 
# Secondly, I did not know about the endswith() method. I would have 
#  used a slice to get the last character and compared it to "y".
#  - A comparable solution, but not as readable.
# Thirdly, I completely forgot that you can use slicing
#  with a colon to get a word without it's last character.
# and no, I would not have written an exception for 1-word
# characters.
