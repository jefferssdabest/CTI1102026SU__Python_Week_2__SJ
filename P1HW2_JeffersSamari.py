# Format: (prompt, data type, label)
questions = (
("Enter budget: ", int, "BUDGET"), 
("Enter your travel destination: ", str, "LOCATION"), 

("How much do you think you will spend on gas? ", int, "Fuel"),

#PSUEDOCODE:
#
# Here's a list of questions to ask, what values to expect, and a
# label to bind them to.
#
# For each question:
# Check that the expected data type is an integer
#   otherwise, use the input function to gather raw input from the user.
#   store that info in a dictionary with the provided label.
#
#  Otherwise, attempt to classify the users input as an integer
#     if that fails, respond "Invalid input. Please enter an integer."
#     ask again until the provided input is an integer.
#     store that info in a dictionary with the provided label.
# 
# With the new data, set aside the entries labeled "BUDGET" and 
# "LOCATION" and store them into seperate values. 
# Subtract each following data point from the value defined in "BUDGET"
# and store that value as "TOTAL"
#
# Finally, display the BUDGET, LOCATION, (*expenses), and TOTAL in a
# preformatted message.

# THIS FUNCTION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SOLICITING INFO FROM THE USER
#
# Iterate through questions and create prompts for the user
#
# 
# returns the result in the following format:
# {'BUDGET': INT, 'LOCATION: STR', 'LABEL': INT, 'LABEL': INT, ...}
